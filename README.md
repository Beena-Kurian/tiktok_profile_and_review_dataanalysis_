#### TikTok Profiles Dataset Exploration

This project involves the exploration and analysis of a TikTok profiles dataset, with the goal of identifying the top 15% of profiles based on engagement metrics and reach. 

The dataset provides key metrics on 1000 TikTok user profiles, including their followers, engagement rates, likes, and video counts, among other features. 

Using this data, the project applies clustering techniques to group customers based on their "reach" (followers and likes) and "impact" (engagement rates).

The dataset and analysis are designed to give insights into user activity on TikTok, identify key influencers, and perform targeted user segmentation based on profile performance.
